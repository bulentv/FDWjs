Javascript Floating &amp; Docking Windows

This is my first project on GH. I will try to create a docking/floating windows library in Javascript.

The project is open for pull requests &amp; contributions.

Tough the library is still in early stage, you can take a look ath the <a href="http://www.bvnet.net/demo/FDWjs/">demo</a> page for the current status.


Features Implemented
========
- Unlimited number of floating / resizing windows
  (Docking function is limited to right-dock)
- Docking/Undocking windows to/from each other
- Maximize / normalize window

Features Planned
================
- Minimize window
- Save / Load layout
- Tabbed windows


Code quality
============
You may notice that the code is too dirty / buggy by the time. As this library has not yet been released, I'm trying hard to fix problems and make code cleaner and apply the standards rules as much as possible.
If you notice that you can improve any part of the code, please do request a pull, or drop me a line describing the change you suggest. 

I also would like to remove all third party library dependencies. (Mostly jQuery, for panel contents, there will be some other libraries of course - Webix, jQuery UI, Sencha etc.)

Why building yet another layout library?
=========================================
I couldn't find any library / framework that covers this kind of flexible / floating / docking layout functionality. That's why I started this project.

Soon
====
- Documentation
- A fully working demo page

IE 8+ Support?
==============
Why not, maybe.

IE 8- Support?
==============
I don't feel myself that crazy yet.
